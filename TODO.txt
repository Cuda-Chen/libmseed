* Add some xSEED/mseed3 parsing tests, reference data.

* Record lists:
  - mstl3_free(), free list and private pointers
  - mstl3_addmsr(), populate list, allocate as needed
  - mstl3_unpacksegment() - new function to unpack to
      user-specified buffer, or allocate buffer if not
      supplied.
